# 🎲 Dice Rolling Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Dice Rolling Game**! This is a simple command-line Python game where the user can roll one or multiple dice as many times as they want. It includes input validation, clean prompts, and robust error handling for a smooth user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Roll any number of dice at a time
- Keep track of how many times you've rolled
- Input validation for:
  - Starting the game (`y/n`)
  - Number of dice (must be a positive integer)
  - Rolling decision (`y/n`)
- Error messages for invalid or non-numeric input
- Clean and readable code with helpful comments

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game starts by asking if you want to begin.
2. You input how many dice you'd like to roll at a time.
3. You can keep rolling the dice (`y`) or stop the game (`n`).
4. After finishing, the program displays how many times you rolled.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Run the Game

Clone the repository or copy the code into a Python file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dice-rolling-game.git](https://github.com/anothershafin/Dice-Rolling-Game.git
cd Dice-Rolling-Game
python dice_game.py
```
Or simply run:
```bash
python dice_game.py
